Mouse Recorder Pro 2 Update Log:

Mouse Recorder Pro 2.0.5.0:

-Fixed the hidden toolbar showing up on unnecessary events (mouse moved away from the toolbar region before the show up delay).

-Added the option to use shortcut keys for recording and playing without the need of holding a modifier key (alt, ctrl, shift, win),
you can start\stop a recording\playing by only pressing one key after setting "None" instead of alt\ctrl\shift\win in the settings window (Edit > Settings)
look for the "Interaction Keys" region under the General tab.

-Added an option to show a save as dialog instead of saving the script right away to the scripts directory on new scripts after pressing the save button,
this option can be turned on by going to Edit > Settings > More and checking the "Show a save dialog on new scripts instead of saving to the scripts directory".

-Added an option to show an overwrite dialog on exiting scripts instead of saving right away.
this option can be turned on by going to Edit > Settings > More and checking the "Show an overwrite dialog if script already exists".

-Fixed the "Pop up MRP right after a recording/playing" feature, now MRP will pop to the top windows
z-order instead of being behind other windows.

-Mouse Recorder Pro 2 now supports DirectX games (Now you can play a script in a DirectX game and it will be played correctly).

-Improved the "Script Playing Speed" feature at the Advanced menu, now it's alot more easier to increase or reduce the script playing
speed instead of editing the script...! (This menu can be found at the main MRP window by pressing the "Advanced" button).

-Fixed the script not being repeated bug occuring when user doesn't use the shortcut keys to stop a recording.

-Added a delay of 1 second after each script playing, this fixes the bug that occures when the script playing calls MRP to record.

-Added some new startup parameters\arguments like "-record" to start a recording immediatly and "-play" to play a script("-autorun" does the same effect), if there is no script loaded the load script
dialog will popup. you may use "-close" to close the application instead of using "-end" (the same effect).

-Added support to Windows 7 new taskbar features: you can now take control over your scripts using the jumplist feature in
windows 7. You are now able to see the progress of Mouse Recorder Pro tasks by just looking at the taskbar.

-Fixed mouse and keyboard recording bugs with Windows 7, Mouse Recorder Pro stopped tracking the mouse and\or the keyboard
in certain situations (Because of the LowLevelHookTimeOut).

-Mouse Recorder Pro 2 will now minimize to the taskbar when recording\playing and show the appropriate icon in each case on
Windows 7 instead of minimizing to the tray icon (On Windows XP and Vista MRP will still minimize to tray).

add delay event after each event. (Some functions were added by suggestions, I appreciate it!)

-Fixed a wrong key mapping "\" (Bug reported).

then ever!

MRP couldn't record well mouse movements (Bug reported).

-Added a feature that tells MRP no to pop up after a recording/playing (can be found in the Settings window).

-This version is more "CPU" friendly.

Notes: This new version can load old MRP2 scripts (MRP2 - MRP2.0.1.0), but older MRP2 versions will not be able
to load any of the newely created scripts of MRP 2.0.2.0 (or old modified script by MRP 2.0.2.0).
Also, if you would like do increase or reduce a script speed use MRPEditor new button "Reduce/Increase Delays" instead of removing delay events,
removing delays events will cause the script to run too much fast that the computer will not be able to respone certain
tasks(if you still wish to remove all delays, you can add a delay between each event in the Advanced window of MRP2).
